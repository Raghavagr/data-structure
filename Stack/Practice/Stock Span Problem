Stock Span Problem :- Find the count of consecutive smaller to left.

    so, where we will get the greater element in the left, we wil stop and subtract the index of greater element from the index of element from where we start
    
EXAMPLE: Suppose we have below array
          100 | 80 | 60 | 70 | 60 | 75 | 85
Index=     0    1     2    3    4    5    6
     
 Now, we have to find from 75, how many consecutive smaller to left are present so.
 
 what we will do is
  start iteration from left to right.
  In stack we will maintain a pair of element with its index.
  and No need to print the vector in reverse order.

so , let's start we will store the index of the the greater element from left as we got
 0     1   2   3   4   5   6
100   80  60  70  60  75  85

-1,   0   1   1   3   1   0

Now, we want the array so, what we do is subtract this vector element from respective index

1    1    1    1   1   4   6

Now, we are asked with 75 so, at 75th index means at 5th position 4 is there so output will be 4 and it is Correct.


Now, let's Implement it with code
