suppose the array is 1 | 3 | 2 | 4

Now, in this problem we will traverse the array from begining itself because we have to see the left element of the current element which we will push ino stack
so,
1) first we will se 1, stack is empty then push -1 to vector, after complete iteration of i=0, push 1 to stack and increase i.
    stack = 1 , vector = -1
    
2) Now, we are at 3, we have 1 in stack and it is its left, but 1 is not greater to 3, then push -1 to vector and push 3 into stack.
    stack= 1, 3,  vector = -1, -1
    
3) we are at 2, we have 1 and 3 into stack. 3 is greater then 2, push 3 to vector and 2 to stack
    stack = 1,3,2  vector = -1, -1, 3
    
4) we are at 4, stack has 1,3,2 as left. none of element is greater then 4 then push -1 to vector
    stack = 1,3,2,4  vector = -1, -1, 3, -1

Finally print the vector as it is and this is our required answer.

brute force of the problem: 
for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
  for(int j=i-1; j>=0; j--) {
 }
}
