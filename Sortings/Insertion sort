INSERTION SORT

Insertion is the sorting algorithm which works such as: 
  - first we suppose there are 2 array as, take the 1st element as 1 sorted array and remaining array from 2nd element as unsorted 2nd array
  - Now, from each pass we take 1 element from unsorted array and compare y each element in 1st array and insert it at its correct position
  - this way we make our 1st array as sorted array,
  - insert the element at its corect pos.
  
  - eg: array[] = {9, 12, 7, 27, 18}
    - suppose 9 is one array, and remaining 2nd
    - now we have to insert 12 into 1st part, compare 12 with 9, so it will be it's pos only
    - then insert 7 into 1st part. sor first compare 7 with 12, swap will be possible. then 7 will be compared with 9, again swap. 7 is at its pos
    - so on things go on.
    
- Insertion Sort is Stable Algorithm -> means if 2 or more element are same then the order of element is maintained
- Insertion sort is Adaptable.  -> means if array is sort then, thus it take the advantage of it. YES.
