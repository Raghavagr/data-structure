Heap Sort := Heap sort sorts the array by creating min heap and max heap.

Logic: - Insert all the elements of an unsorted array into heap.
        - Remove the maximum elements of heap(root node element) and replace it with the last value of array.
        - Heapify
        - repeat the process untill heap remains with single element.
        
        
 ALGORITHM:-  HEAPSORT(A,N): An array with N no. of elements is given. This algorithm sorts the element of A.
 
 1) Build the heap[H]
    h = createHeap(N),   BuildHeap(h,A,N)
    
 2) Initialize :
      oldSize = h->count
      
 3) Sort A by repeatedly deleting the root of h
     for(i=n-1;i>0;i--) {
        a) temp = h->array[0]
           h->array[0] = h->array[h->count-1]
           h->array[h->count-1] = temp
           
        b) h->count;
        c) dercolate(h,i)
     }
     
 4) h->count = oldSize
 5) exit.
