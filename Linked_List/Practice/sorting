// Sort a singly linked list

It works similar as we sort arrays, using 2 for loop
- First element will be compared by every other element, and in 1st iteration we will get the smallest element of list.
- and so on it goes untell we reaches at last Node.

void sorting() {
    struct Node *ptr, *cpt;
    int temp;
    ptr = head;
    while(ptr->next != NULL) {
        cpt = ptr->next;
        while(cpt != NULL) {
            if(ptr->data > cpt->data) {
                temp = ptr->data;
                ptr->data = cpt->data;
                cpt->data = temp;
            }
            cpt = cpt->next;
        }
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }
}
