// WAP to print Nth node from end of linked list

// approach is simple enough
 - First using iteration find the length of linked list
 - then the resultant index will be = (length - n) + 1
      here, n means the nth node given as input in program
 - and whtever index you got print the data at that index else -1 (same as previous prog to return nth node)
 
 
 IMPLEMENTATION
 
 //Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
int getNthFromLast(Node *head, int n)
{
    // Your code here
    struct Node *ptr = head;
    int count=0;
    while(ptr != NULL) {
        count++;
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }
    
    int ind = (count - n) + 1;
    
    int cnt=1;
    while(head!=NULL) {
        if(cnt == ind) {
            return head->data;
        }
        cnt++;
        head = head->next;
    }
    return -1;
}
