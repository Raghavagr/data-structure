// Move last element to front of a given Linked List

// que) Write a function that moves the last element to the front in a given Singly Linked List.
    For example, if the given Linked List is 1->2->3->4->5, then the function should change the list to 5->1->2->3->4.
    
ALGORITHM:

APPROACH is very simple that,
- take 2 pointer as last and second last.
- iterate through list till lst is not NULL
- make the next of second last node as NULL
- AND next of last as head and head equal to last.

// IMPLEMENTATION

void move_to_first(struct Node *head) {
    struct Node *last, *seclast;
    last = head;
    while(last != NULL) {
        seclast = last;
        last = last->next;
    }
    
    //mark next of seclast as NULL
    seclast->next = NULL;
    last->next = head;
    head = last;
}
